# Projectie

The reason Projectie exists comes from the want to know how much money I have in my savings account at any one time.
It is very easy to spend $100 here, $200 there, without having an idea the effect that would have on my balance at the end of the month, or the end of the year. When a goal is so large and so far in the future, you dont properly consider the effect spending money now will have on that goal.

So, I created Projectie. I think that name will be more of an internal code name - I'm toying with calling the final app Carrot. Projectie being Dutch for projection, which is what this app does, projects your balance in the future. But Carrot for the carrot which this app hopefully dangles in front of its user. A carrot to follow and word towards.
